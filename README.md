# ticTacToe

This project was done as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. My design was inspired by a user named Theonlyhamster on TOP, but I created everything from scratch on my own. I aimed to shoot much higher than my capability at the start, and it certainly was a challenge. I suspect the work would have been much easier using Async functions, but I have not yet learned how to use those so I challenged myself to code every animation based on what I currently know. The timing of the animations was achieved using setTimeout() with specific values depending on the animations. Overall, there is still room to improve, but I am happy with how my first attempt at a project with animated actions turned out.
